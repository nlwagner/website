Welcome to my website! Here you can find links to all my social medias, <a href="/assets/pdf/CV.pdf">CV</a>, and other stuff I think is cool.

I'm currently finishing up my Ph.D. at Baylor University with Peter James and will be starting a postdoc this fall with Harriet Lau at Brown University. 

I'm a firm believer in open and reproducable science and I aim to promote equitiable, diverse, and inclusive work practices in projects and groups I'm involved with.
