Welcome to my website! Here you can find links to all my social medias, <a href="https://nlwagner.github.io/website/assets/pdf/CV.pdf" download="Wagner_CV.pdf">CV</a>, and other stuff I think is cool.

I'm currently a LunaSCOPE postdoctoral research associate at Brown University working with Harriet Lau and Alex Evans on some fun lunar tidal tomography problems. My interests lie across the solar system in using geophysical, geodetic, and geodynamic methods to understand the interior structure and evolution of various planetary bodies.

I'm a firm believer in open and reproducable science and I aim to promote equitiable, diverse, and inclusive work practices in projects and groups I'm involved with.
